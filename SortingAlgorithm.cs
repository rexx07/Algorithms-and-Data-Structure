/*In given text file, print the words with their frequency. Now print the kth
word in term of frequency.
    Hint:- 
    a) First solution may be you can use the sorting and return the kth
element.
    b) Second solution: You can use the kth element quick select
algorithm.
    c) Third solution: You can use Hashtable or Trie to keep track of the
frequency. Use Heap to get the Kth element.*/
